Abort stale route loader fetches on navigation. Previously, navigating away while loaders were in-flight only set a `cancelled` boolean — the underlying HTTP requests continued to completion in the background, wasting bandwidth and server resources. Now an `AbortController` is created per navigation effect, its signal is threaded through `fetchRouteLoadersInParallel` and `fetchRouteLoader` to the native `fetch` call, and the controller is aborted in the effect cleanup. The same pattern is applied to `reloadCurrentRoute`.
