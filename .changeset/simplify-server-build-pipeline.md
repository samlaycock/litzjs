Simplify the production server build pipeline. The RSC environment now uses `codeSplitting: false` to produce a single-file server bundle directly, eliminating the subprocess re-bundling step (`bundleServerWrapper`). Removes the `node:async_hooks` shim in favour of the native module. Exposes RSC plugin options via `litz({ rsc: { ... } })` for configuring encryption, CSS transforms, and other `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` settings.
