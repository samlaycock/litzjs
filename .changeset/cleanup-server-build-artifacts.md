"litzjs": patch
---

Clean up orphaned intermediate build artifacts from the server output directory after finalization. The `@vitejs/plugin-rsc` multi-environment build leaves behind `assets/` chunks and `__vite_rsc_*` helper files that are consumed during the finalization step but not removed. After this change, `dist/server/` contains only the self-contained `index.js`.
