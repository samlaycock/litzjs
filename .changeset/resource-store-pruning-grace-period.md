Defer resource store entry cleanup via `queueMicrotask` to prevent eviction during React's synchronous unsubscribe/resubscribe cycles. Previously, `cleanupResourceEntry` deleted entries immediately when `listeners.size` reached zero, which could race with React strict mode's double-mount or concurrent rendering transitions. The deferred cleanup re-checks the listener count after the microtask, allowing React to re-subscribe before the entry is removed.
